Use \nof the malevolent programs in computers and over internet by malicious people to \nattack data or sell contraband and someone else\u2019s identity is known as cybercrime. \nThis type of crime is committed with the use of computers and internet. A cybercrime \ncriminal is capable of hacking and planting viruses to destroy website and other \nportals across the world. Fraudulent transactions and online banking frauds are carried \nout by th em by gaining access to highly confidential information as well as cyber \npornography and various other crimes are committed. In simple words, no one is \nsecure in the cyber world.  \nLike the conventional concept of crime, cybercrime is also an act or omissio n which \nresults in breach of law and backed by sanction of the state. Two essential ingredients \nof cybercrimes are actus reus and mens rea . The main reason behind the growing \nmenace of cybercrime is our heavy dependence on computers and internet. Cyber \nspaces have advantages as well as disadvantages. Conventional crime can be \nprevented to an extent by patrolling of policemen, but in the cyber space, information \nis open to Trojan Horses and other viruses as well as to cyber stalking and cyber \nterrorism. This type of crime poses a bigger challenge to the polic, prosecutors and \nlegislators. \nStatement of problem  \nCybercrime is now a global concern engulfing the world. India is also not free from \nits clutches. It is a unique threat that is not confined to any bor der. It can be carried \nout from anywhere in the world and against any computer system. This problem has \nbecome a global issue and is becoming more difficult to bring under control.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1786, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20a44020-c687-4085-98cb-dc739bd2f44f": {"__data__": {"id_": "20a44020-c687-4085-98cb-dc739bd2f44f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "241", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49202a1a-8f3e-40de-9e1d-4a6fcf4f1537", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "241", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "hash": "4bd728b43e5bf53c1d39386d24c1c337f305a41a1a17aeb2f9300e1a121d1a4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "2 \n \nObjective of the study  \nThe researcher has undertaken this topic to analyse the law of cybercrime in a \ncomprehensive manner and achieve new insights to it. The main objectives of the \npresent study are under: \n\uf0b7 To understand the basic concept of the cybercrime and forms of cyber crimes \n\uf0b7 To analyse Indian cyber crime \n\uf0b7 To decipher as to how the issue of cybercrime has been dealt with in the \nIndian scenario; \n\uf0b7 To point out the possible defects in the existing law relating to cybercrime; \n\uf0b7 To suggest the reform and remedial measure for the prevention and control of \ncybercrime. \nScope and limitation  \nThe scope of the study is to do a detailed study of cyber crimes, their magnitude and \nnature and throw light on who are the ones responsible for it. The researcher will also \nanalyse the success and failure of the efforts taken by India in c ombating this type of \ncrime. Efforts will be made to analyse the law as laid down in the IT Act, 2000, its \nimplementation, shortcomings and efforts to repair them as well as referring to the \nITAA, 2008. The researcher will also compare the selected provisi ons of Indian \nlegislation with that of US and UK wherever necessary. The only limitation of this \npaper is that it covers only the laws of India and only two other developed countries \ni.e. US and UK. \nHypothesis  \nThe hypothesis of this paper is that cyber se curity at national level is poor and \ninadequate. The cyber space is not adequately protected. A huge number of \npopulation is present in the cyber space every moment and are using very well \ndeveloped complicated technologies. Developed technologies require developed \nprotection mechanisms. This demands  for having comprehensive and effective laws \nand regulations for the protection of the population from the various cyber crimes.

These sites provided space for many to relax, connect with old friends \nand also get new also.1 But the cyber-criminal organizations have sadly misused these \nsites to serve their criminal acts. In the past couple of years, people started spending \nmore  time on these networks as the populations are gradually dependent on them. In \nthe digital era, information technology growth influences the lives of people all over \nthe world. Day after day, modern inventions and discoveries have broadened the \nscience spectrum and created new problems for the legal community. With the rapid \ndevelopment of this technology leads to the commission on cyber space with \nemerging different types of new cybercrime  today, which has also been a topic of \nglobal interest in the future. \nIn the cyber world era as computer use became more widespread, the rise of \ntechnology also grew, and people became more familiar with the word 'cyber.' The \nevolution of IT gives rise to the \"cyber space\" in which internet provides all people \nwith equal opportunities to access information , analysis, data storage, etc.  by using \nhigh technology.2 Such offences are like the assault on people, companies, or \ngovernments' guarded records. Such types of attacks don't  exist on the physical body \nbut on virtual body, either personal or corporate. \nTechnology has exploded into communities, businesses, and  individual\u2019s life  over \nthe last two decades, altering the way people study, work and interact . People in \ndifferent parts of the world can connect on a range of devices , such as computers, cell \nphones or tablets in real time.3 A text message, photo, video,  or email exchanged by a \nsingle person can be seen by hun  Dreds users  in a couple of seconds, and can go \nviral. The IT  has now become a modern tool for harassing,, doing misconduct or \nbullying,  manipulating and harming others. \n                                                 \n1   Dr.S.V.Joga Rao \u201cLaw of Cyber Crimes and Information Technology Law\u201d, p.109 (2 nd ed. 2009). \n2 Farooq Ahmad, \u201cCyber Law in India- Law on Internet\u201d, p. 367, (2nd ed. 2008) . \n3 Saraswathi Murali, \u201c Information Technology Handbook\u201d,  p.234, (2003)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2347, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a7f9f28-1c88-4bba-b88a-103dc0256724": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a7f9f28-1c88-4bba-b88a-103dc0256724", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b1a5ce2-14de-48b3-8cae-0f6d3bb3664b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "hash": "dc50647c12bf128f6f6057143b29aa48793389b932004198eca04968510875e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7 \n \nThrough a socio-cultural viewpoint, there is a negative distinction between the \nlimitations of machine criminal activity of  environmental (computer availability) and \nsocietal (norms, legislation)  which is a direct consequence of technology \nglobalization.

Now it's used to \nexplain anything related to computers , IT, the internet and the complex culture of the \ninternet. Also referred to as 'Cyber Space' is the cyber environment in which all \ninformation technology   Driven contact and actions take place. Cyberspace can not \nbe placed spatially. It's made of intangible objects like the website, forum, social \nnetworks, personal information, reputation and email addresses. Cyber space can be \ncalled an online global community with quick connectivity and no territorial barriers.5 \nCyber space is the interactive system of computer networks where online \ncommunication takes place between the people  and where people can communicate, \nexchange ideas, transfer knowledge, provide social support, perform business,  create \nartistic media, direct actions, participate in political dialogue, etc.6 Cyberspace, the \nmodern frontier, is mankind's shared heritage, but sadly certain people exploit the \ncommon heritage and thus cyberspace is indeed a new frontier with various forms of \ncrime. Now it's used to explain anything related to computers, IT, the internet and the \ncomplex culture of the internet.7 The people participating in cyberspace are \nrecognized as netizens by the fusion of two terms 'Net' and 'citizen.' Whereas Netizens \nimplies any person affiliated with the use of Internet, computers, IT. \n                                                 \n4 S.C.

Astonishing \nchanges have been made in the crime area. The growing understanding of criminality \nall over the world relies on the development of individuals in society. The definition \nof crime occurs in different ways in various countries at all times, Like if xyz crime is \ncrime in country A, same may not be  crime in country B. \nThe emergence of the new method of the criminality due to industrial growth and \nincome accumulation,   Dramatic advancement in the mass media has modified the \ndefinition of conventional crimes such as homicide, dacoity, kidnapping, arson, \nstealing, pornography, adultery, etc. both quantitatively and qualitatively, and brought \nnew modes of crime. \nNATURE OF CRIMES \nIn fact, most of the societies have such values, principles, practices and rituals that its \nparticipants indirectly accept as favorable to their well-being and safe growth.

There are many human behaviours in our society some are \nforbidden by civil law, criminal law and moral code, crimes and those not forbidden \nby these are not wrong.  The evolving character of crime can be understood as \nfollows: \nCrime is a public wrong according to Blackstone. He describes crime in two ways: \nfirst, criminality is an act committed or excluded in violation of public statute that \nforbids or commands it. We cannot support this concept in its entirety because \nAdministrative Law and constitutional law etc. are infringements of public law but are \nnot crimes. Second, he modifies his definition of crime and states a crime is a breach \nof the duties of public rights owed to the society as a whole, regarded as a \ncommunity.10 \n Editor of the Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, Stephen, further modified the \naforementioned definition and said \"a crime is a violation of a right, considered in \nreference to the evil tendency of such violation as regards the community at large.\"11 \nHe further added that an act is crime if it is forbidden by the law and against the \nsocieties\u2019 moral sentiments. \nSecondly, Crime is social wrong. John Gillin describes criminality as an act which has \nbeen proven to be objectively detrimental to society, or which is considered to be \nharmful socially by a group of individuals who have the ability to impose their views, \nand which puts such activities under the prohibition of constructive sanctions.12 \nThirdly, crime as conventional wrong. According to Edwin Sutherland Crime as \ncriminal conduct in contravention of the law.

Initially in \nEurope wrongdoer were inflicted with many charges, they did not considered the \nMens rea as important element. But later on development in criminal law, before \nimposing any punishment, they start consider both Mens rea and actus reus.  And acts \nreas must be proved beyond the reasonable doubt.  \nInitially crimes were simple and in very limited nature so that time criminal law was \nalso plain. After 13th century some cases of serious offence came they led to first \ndistinction between trot and crime. With criminal liability moral blame was linked. By \nthis change mental element in liability got recognition. \n There are two important element of crime namely  \n1. Actus reus in Cyber Crimes \nActus reus defined as \u201csuch result of human conduct as the law seeks to prevent\u201d15 in \ncybercrime actus reus is highly varied and dynamic. In simple word actus reus means \nresult of human conduct.it does not include mental element. it does not limited  an act \nonly , but also includes state of affairs. \nC.J. Smith & B. Hogan found actus reus to be a product of human action because the \nlaw attempts to prevent it. Simply guilty intent is not adequate to resolve the criminal \nfault but any act or omission is required to complete the offence.

The act can be \nconsidered a crime may be said to have happened when a person makes use of \ncomputer function; or trying to obtain access from the internet or sending signals via \ndifferent computers.16 In cases of rape, an important feature of the actus reus is \nabsence of the consent on part of prosecutor. If the prosecutor can not show this \ndenial of consent then the actus reus of accused does not prove and the case will lose \nhere. In this context we can say that mens rea also forms part of actus reus. \n2. Mens rea in cybercrime  \nAccording to the current jurisprudence crime can be committed with mens rea. Mens \nrea is  second basic factor that constitutes crime, sometimes referred to as 'a guilty \nmind.' definition of mens rea  underwent a gradual shift before modern criminal law \ncame to accept as often necessary a guilty mind of some sort or some such mental \nfeature. 17Mens rea, refers to the individual's thematic intention to commit the act. \nThe act remains same although the state of mind causes the act 'reus' and therefore an \noffence. Quick all crimes need evidence of some kind of a mental dimension. many \ncourts held that 'primarily all crime exists in the mind' Each offence requires a clear \nstate of mind reflected by the terms in the particular section of the law: \u2018recklessly\u2019, \n\u2018with intent\u2019, \u2018maliciously\u2019, \u2018wilfully\u2019, unlawfully\u2019, \u2018knowingly\u2019, \u2018fraudulently\u2019, \n\u2018dishonestly\u2019, \u2018corruptly\u2019, \u2018knowing or believing\u2019, \u2018allowing\u2019 and \u2018permitting\u2019 \nExpressing different mental states which differ from one another. However, the basic \ntenets of criminal liability are motive, recklessness and knowledge.18 \nIt consists of a large number of different mental activities such as recklessness, \nnegligence, intention etc. word intention is used for a man's state of mind not only \nbecause of his ability to predict but also because it contains the expectation of the \nfuture result of his actions, as it is rightly believed that there can be no intention \n                                                 \n16 Ibid.  \n17 J.C.

Since the rise of e-crimes, the legal \ncommunity is facing the challenge of defining mens rea in cybercrimes, in addition to \nmany others.19 As an important component for deciding mens rea in cybercrime, the \noffender's part is that at the time of causing t computer to perform the task, he / she \nmust be informed that  access intended to be obtained was not lawful. There must be \nintention on the part of hacker to secure access, although that intention may be \ndirected with any computer and not with a particular computer. Therefore the hackers \ndoes not need to be aware of exactly which computer he / she was attacking. There \nare two important ingredients that make up the mens rea, in hacking, 1) access \nintended to be protected must've been unauthorized, 2)as there should be knowledge \non the part of hacker regarding the access. \nThe mens rea requires two important elements in the case of cybercrimes. 1) \n'Intention to secure access to the any software or data stored on any computer, \ncomputer network or computer system must be made.  2) The individual must know \nthat access he intends to obtain is unauthorized at the time when he commits actus \nreus.20The nature and skilled involved in the cybercrime such that current legal \nframework couldn't do much to handle and contain same thing.

The term cyber signifies the cyber \nspace, and it means the computer-modelled information space in which there are \ndifferent objects or information of symbols image exist. It is, therefore, the place \nwhere computer programs operate and data processing takes place.24 \nCybercrimes are nothing but real-life crimes perpetuated in digital medium and thus \nthere is little distinction between the concept of a crime in the cyber world and the \nreal world. The only difference is medium of crime. Cybercrime is ' 'transnational or \ninternational' \u2013 there is no border in cyber world. Computer crime, cybercrime, \nelectronic crime, e-crime or hi-tech crime typically refers to illegal activity in which \ncomputer or network is  source, device, target or crime location  as well as \nconventional crime through  use of technology such as , Internet fraud, child \npornography. \nBroadly cybercrime means an act or omission, which committed on through internet \nconnectivity, may me directly or indirectly, this is forbidden by any statute, and for \nwhich corporal and/or monetary punishment is given. \nDEFINITION OF CYBER CRIME \nThe term 'cybercrime' as a generic term that refers to all type criminal activities \nperpetrated through the use of computers, the Internet on the cyber space and the \nwww.

In plain language cybercrime \nmeans crime engaged in computer network or computer. But in such simplistic and \nlimited terms complex nature of the cybercrimes can't be sufficiently expressed. \nCybercrime, according to Pavan Duggal, refers to all activities that are carried out \nwith criminal intention  in cyberspace or using  internet medium. These can be either \ntraditional or newly developed criminal activities with growth of new medium. Any \nconduct that basically offends human awareness may be included in the cybercrime \ncontext. \nCommit a crime with the using of computer technology is better definition of \ncybercrime; engaging in activities that threaten the ability of a society to maintain \ninternal order. So this definition covers both traditional cybercrimes and the emerging \nones. This also includes the use of computer technology, and not just the use of the \nnetworked computer technology. \nTRADITIONAL CRIME AND CYBER CRIME \nCybercrimes, which are distinctly different from the traditional crimes, are often more \ndifficult to detect and prosecute. Cybercrimes are perpetrated by perpetrators through \nsmall, targeted cyber threats, and large networks of commercial purposes leased, \nhijacked computers are used to launch significant attacks.26 Researching on  legal \nissues of  the cybercrime in China, by Chen Junjiing concludes that such crimes are \nmuch more widespread unlike traditional crimes and these are increasing at  faster \nrate. In addition, cybercrime harms society more than traditional crime, and is much \nmore difficult to investigate. \nCybercrime contains any computer and network-related criminal act. In addition, \ncyber-crime also includes traditional Internet-based crimes. or example;  \ntelemarketing, hate crimes, fraud on the Internet and identity theft, are considered \n                                                 \n25 Prabhash Dalei & Tannya Brahme, \u201dCyber law in India: An analysis\u201d, 2  IJHAS,  p.1, (2013).  \n26 The Swedish Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 2008 report,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2354, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ee8659a-ad2b-4451-89da-71742a972a4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ee8659a-ad2b-4451-89da-71742a972a4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "255", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f3f1338-eada-4860-99fe-031f76f41aa3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "255", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "hash": "1d3851884165d237d234a86af48bca03c155f6b1e4eb2b9fc7b907d96c055f09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "16 \n \ncybercrimes when illegal activities are committed using a computer and  Internet.27 \nCybercrime hackers are skilled criminals, disgruntled workers, professional,  \ndisillusioned youth, and state critics in contrast with conventional crimes. \nThe other distinction is based on evidence of crimes between these two words. In \nconventional crimes the offenders typically leave some traces of the crime, such as \nfingerprints or any other physical evidence, after or during the execution of the crime. \nBut in cybercrimes cybercriminals commit their crime via the internet and there is \nvery little chance of leaving any evidence. According to Forensic investigators who \nusually have experience of difficulty in evidence gathering for conviction of the cyber \ncriminals because they either  change their identities or do  crime on the basis of the \nfake identities But as compared to conventional criminals, faking their age, sexuality, \nrace , etc. is very difficult.28 \nDepending on the use of power, those two words can be distinguished. Many of the \ncrimes such as robbery, murder, rape, etc. in traditional crimes involve use of excess \nforce which leads to the physical injury on the person suffered. But as compared to \ncybercrimes there's really no requisite to use any type of force since in this crime \ncriminals only use other person's identities in order to steal any private data etc. \nRELATION BETWEEN CYBER CRIME AND CYBER SECURITY \nCyber crime \nCyber criminality is a crime involving use of the computer devices and Internet.

Information security-   intellectual property, business records, customer data, \npersonal data, etc. Information included.  It is therefore important for a \ncompany to have very strong cyber security for data/information in order to \navoid leakage.  \nSecurity of information involves the safeguarding of sensitive information \nfrom unlawful access, use or other damage. This also means that critical data \nwill not get lost if any problems such as malfunction of system, natural \ndisasters, fraud or other potentially harmful circumstances occur. Integrity, \nconfidentiality and availability are the characteristics which define information \nsecurity. Data privacy , data quality, data reliability  and  Data confidentiality,  \nare all part of information security. \n3. Network Security- Network security is about safeguarding network and data \nusability and reliability. Network penetration test is performed to evaluate \nvulnerabilities within a system and network. \nThis applies to broad variety of security policies to thwart and track \nunauthorized access, abuse, computer device harm and other network \nstructures. Network protection extends coverage across companies and \norganizations, to multiple computer networks covering private and public \ncommunication systems. \n4. Business continuity planning- Its aim is to prepare for any form of intrusion or \ncyber threat by detecting timely threats to  systems and evaluating how they \ncould impact the operations and methods to combat that danger. This also \ncalled as Disaster Recovery. \n5. Operational security (OPSEC)- it is used for  protecting functions of the \norganisation. This defines essential information and properties in functional \nsystem to monitor the risks and vulnerabilities. \n6. End-user education- Training their employees about the cyber security is \ncritical for an organization, since data breached caused due to the human error. \nEach employee must be aware of and have knowledge to deal with the common \ncyber threats. \n                                                 \n35 Ibid.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2169, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a46ab247-0aec-4af9-9c01-23f5db55d99c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a46ab247-0aec-4af9-9c01-23f5db55d99c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "259", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f8dcf23a-130b-41ea-8557-6a61a78cda43", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "259", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "hash": "e46caad8c0fbc30bf3fece45e8fe4855a22803af0cfe0da9ac5a4e18f6030cfb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "20 \n \nTraining can help management to get used to and threats to system users and \ntraining of user will help eliminate resistance to change and improvements and \nlead to closer user scrutiny. \n7.

CYBERCRIME AGAINST THE PERSON \nCybercrime against persons committed. This form of offences directly influenced the \nindividual's personality. Following are the cybercrimes of some kinds that threat the \nuser.36 \nHarassment via E-Mails- This form of harassment is very popular by file \nattachments, sending letters, & links, i.e. through e-mails. Harassment is growing \nnowadays as the use of social media sites. like Twitter, Facebook, orkut, instagram, \netc. day by day increasing. \nCyber-Stalking- The phrase derives from the term 'stalking,' which means following \na person to embarrass or harass that person. If computer or email is used for commit \nstalking.  \nIt is often achieved by using certain criminal activities such as   abuse of identity, \nextortion, defamation, spoofing etc. Cyber stalkers may create fake websites, create \nfake forums, send threatening spam, make fake profile or send harassing mails for \nstalk another person. \nCyber Defamation- for causing defamation Injury can be done through oral or \nwritten words, or through signs or visible representations. The person making that \ndefamatory comment must be intent to lowering the image of person about whom the \naccusation was made in general public's eyes. \n                                                 \n36 Prabhash Dalei &amp; Tannya Brahme, Cyber law in India: An analysis, 2013.

It is a major step in \nclaiming compensation, combatting data theft, security practices, etc. \nSection 43 deals with penalties in case of damage to computer or computer system, \netc. this is  first ever provision for combating data theft issue. The IT Industry had \nbeen demanding legislation for a long time to address the issue of data theft, just like \nother physical theft. This section also deals with the civil offence of data theft. If a \nperson, without the permission of owner of the computer, accesses,  introduces virus, \ntakes data, downloads copies, damages any computer or denies access to it to an \nauthorized user, will be liable to pay Rs. 1 crore damages. It was removed by the \nITAA 2008.  \nThe interesting part of this provision is the civil liability for the offences. Criminality \nin offence of data theft is given under Sections 65 and 66. Spreading virus or writing a \nvirus program, or other malware in a computer system, etc. all come under civil \nliability. This section defines all the words like computer database, computer virus, \nSource Code, etc.  \nThere were debates about the liability of the organization which was sued for data \ntheft. For the first few years of IT Act 2000, questions like responsibility of the \nowner, employee\u2019s liability,  concept of due diligence, all of these were debated in \ncourt litigations like that of the Bazee.com case43. Thus, the need was felt to have a \nseparate provision for corporate liability for information security and data protection. \nA new sec. 43A was introduced in the ITAA 2008. It deals with compensation for \nfailure in protecting data. This is like a watershed in the domain of data protection at \nthe corporate level. It says that when a corporate body is negligent in the \nimplementing reasonable security practices, affected person entitle to get damages by \nway of compensation from corporate body . The section explains the terms \u201cbody \ncorporate\u201d, \u201creasonable security practices\u201d and \u201csensitive personal data or \ninformation\u201d.  \nThus, the corporate responsibility was brought into picture by the insertion of Sec. \n43A., the corporate are under the obligation to adopt reasonable security measures. \n                                                 \n43 Sharat Babu Digumatri v.

The difference between the two is that \nin Section 43, it was a civil offence with compensation and damages, whereas in this \nsection, it is the same act done with a criminal intention for making it a criminal \noffence. The act of data theft mentioned in Section 43, if done fraudulently and \ndishonestly is punishable under this sec. with 3 years\u2019 imprisonment or 5 lakh rupees \nfine or both.

The term \u2018hacking\u2019 does not exist in the section now. \nEarlier, the term hacking was used in the section. Simultaneously, there would be \nacademic courses on \u2018ethical hacking\u2019, etc. This created a very ambiguous situation \nwherein an illegal activity is being taught academically only with the addition of the \nword \u2018ethical\u2019 with it. The question is whether something which is an offence can be \ntaught academically by prefixing \u2018ethical\u2019 to it. Then, courses like \u2018ethical assault\u2019, \n\u2018ethical burglary\u2019 can also be taught for physical defence. This anomaly was brought \nto an end by ITAA when Section 66 was rephrased by mapping it with civil liability \nof Sec. 43 and removed the word \u2018Hacking\u2019. Hacking is still and offence under this \nsection. Though some experts interpret it definitely according their convenience. They \nsay hacking is for the good purpose and \u2018cracking\u2019 is for the illegal purpose. The \ntechnology is same.

The \ngovernment or investigating agency like Police department, have not taken any \nserious step to create awareness among the public about the provisions of the Act, \nwhich is very essential considering that there is new technology that have to be learnt \nby legal professionals, litigants, the judicial officers  and the public at large.

However, it may not be enough to introduce more \nlegislation to deter cybercrime as we know that cybercrime conviction rates are very \nlow compared to IPC. What may act as a deterrent is the certainty of punishment and \nnot severity of punishment.

Unauthorized modification of computer material69 \nMaximum sentence prescribed for the offences is ten years for the fourth offence. The \nsentence for the second and the third offence is five years whereas it is six months for \nthe first offence. The first prosecution under this Act was brought about in 1995 when \nan individual, Christopher Pile, was prosecuted for distributing a computer virus. He \nhad created the virus Pathogen and Queeg. Both of these malwares implemented his \nSMEG (Simulated Metamorphi c Encryption Generator) polymorphic engine.

Computer misuse was added to the list of serious \ncrimes with maximum penalty being increased to a prison sentence of 14 years and \nfine, if found guilty. If an individual is charged with an offence that constitutes a \nthreat to the national security or hum an welfare in general, the sentence can be upto \nlifetime imprisonment. \nThere were subsequent developments to the Act. In 2006, Section 37 of the Police and \nJustice Act, 2006 was inserted in the Computer Misuse Act as Section 3A. This \nsection classified making, supplying or obtaining any article for use in a malicious act \nusing a computer, as a criminal activity. \nPROBLEMS \nThus, the Computer Misuse Act was enacted to help deal with the problem of misuse \nof computers by way of \u2018hacking\u2019 and \u2018unauthorised access\u2019. \nThe Act was a way forward in terms of cyber laws in the UK. However, it still had \nmany loopholes and had failed to combat the challenges of unauthorised access \ngained by hackers or viruses created by cyber criminals. The case of R v. Bedworth  \n[1991] proves the problem with Section 2 in proving \u2018intent\u2019. This case is a peculiar \nexample of how the offender had used the defence of addiction to counter the \nallegation of intention of committing the crime. He had pleaded that he had no \nintention in commi tting the crime. Strangely, even though addiction is not a defence \nto a crime, the jury had acquitted him as they believed that he did not deserve heavy \npenalty. \nAnother loophole that might come as a blow is that the judges might lack technical \nknowledge r egarding the use of computers. Inadequate knowledge will make it \ndifficult to apply the law properly and tend to make inappropriate interpretations. This \nproblem was highlighted in Rv. Cropp [1991] where the judge acquitted the person on \nthe basis of his opinion that an offence was only committed if one computer is used to \n                                                 \n74Explanatory Notes , Serious Crime Act 2015 available at \nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/9/pdfs/ukpgaen_20150009_en.pdf> last accessed on May \n25, 2020.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2252, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d088eb2-9dd4-407b-a731-558ccab2ad7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d088eb2-9dd4-407b-a731-558ccab2ad7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "298", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "898a2280-ea57-4dc7-a58d-cfc5819993f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "298", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "hash": "37cbaba20d5df1fc5096fedbacc12343a17a3a511725bd2604df96e39214ae38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "59 \n \nobtain material stored on another computer.

The definition of \u2018computer crimes\u2019 is too broad in the Act as \nit simply states \u2018unauthorised access to computer material\u2019. This had created problems \nin the case of DPP v. Bignell [1998] . The   Drafting of the law seems very general \nand casual. With time, it has just become a blunt  instrument when policing \ncybercrimes. This is proved from the fact that inspite of high reporting of crimes, \nthere have been very few prosecutions till date75. \nSPAM, MALWARE AND THE LAW \nMostly, everybody deals with the problem of spam. The problem of spam is \nwidespread. It does not only include inappropriate content but it is also used to deliver \nmalicious code to the recipients. Spam messages work in a way that the recipients will \nopen the link to the website which are infected with malicious codes by cyber \ncriminals. This method is also used by phishers to direct victims to fake websites from \nwhere their confidential data is stolen. \nTo address the problem of spam, the Department for Trade and Industry introduced \nthe \u201cPrivacy and Electronic Communication Regulations (EC Directive) 2003.\u201d These \nregulations exist alongside the Data Protection Act and the GDPR. These regulations \nprotect specific pri vacy rights of people in relation to electronic communications 76. \nThey have specific rules on: \na) Marketing calls, emails, texts and faxes \nb) Cookies (and similar technologies) \nc) Keeping communications services secure \nd) Customer privacy as regards traffic and locatio n data, itemized billing, line \nidentification, and directory listings77. \n                                                 \n75 Michael J L Turner, \u201cComputer Evidence\u201d available at \nhttps://www.computerevidence.co.uk/Cases/CMA.htm  last accessed on May 25, 2020 \n76 PECR, available at https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/what-are-pecr/ last accessed on \nMay 25, 2020 \n77 Ibid.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2162, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0771b49-b4b6-4546-b642-846f1326a32c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0771b49-b4b6-4546-b642-846f1326a32c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "299", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "58d41780-64c5-4b12-ad23-368193a925e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "299", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "hash": "f027dd25f3d0636003319ddb3b74899dd338aeede3e8cd34ea36952318de66ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "60 \n \nThese regulations were derived from the European Law. It had implemented the \nEuropean Directive 2002/58/EC, which is also called \u2018the e-privacy Directive\u201978. \nThe e-privacy Directive is complementing the general data protection regime. It also \nsets out very specific privacy rights of all entities in the domain of electronic \ncommunication. It very categorically acknowledges the fact that the use of computer \nand internet poses new threats to the privacy of people. \nThe PECR have been amended many times till now. Last amendment was in 2018 \nwhere cold calling of claims management services was banned. Secondly, director\u2019s \nliability for serious breaches of marketing rules was inserted. In 2019, c old calling of \npension schemes was banned and the definition of consent was incorporated from the \nGDPR. \nThese regulations mandated that companies must seek permission before sending \nemails or SMS messages. The law states that no one is permitted to transmi t \nunsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing unless the recipient \nhas consented to receiving such messages.  \nHowever, there are limitations of this law. These regulations only apply to individual \nemail addresses and not business email addresses. The penalties are also inadequate as \ncompared to the ones provided under the Computer Misuse Act, 1990. Breach of any \nprovision of this regulation requires reporting of the act too the Information \nCommissioner\u2019s Office who is responsible for dec iding whether the person should be \ntaken to the court or not. \nAnother serious limitation is that the legislation is only applicable to senders within \nthe UK. Most spam originates beyond the UK (Russia and US are the top sources of \nspam)79. Thus, if this leg islation is not applicable beyond UK, it is not effective \nagainst the actual spammers. This highlights a very important problem with the \nmeasures taken by the countries to combat cyber crime and deal with cyber criminals: \ngeo-political restrictions. \n \n                                                 \n78 Ibid. \n79 Darya Gudkova , Daria Bronnikova, \u201cKaspersky Security Bulletin: Spam Evolution 2008\u201d , March 2 \n, 2009.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2177, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "849429e6-c605-4c14-b987-bbfb68944547": {"__data__": {"id_": "849429e6-c605-4c14-b987-bbfb68944547", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "300", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e525b67-7e59-4869-a657-b92434e73f0b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "300", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "hash": "068ba6115d567bb3f9044d095e628ae992e7e6a4498621d475fcb3c42a021f4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "61 \n \nTHE POLICE AND JUSTICE ACT 2006 \nThis Act incorporates the amendments to the Computer Misuse Act.

It was adopted in November 2001 by the \nEU Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe80. \nThe treaty is very wide n scope and covers a wide range of cybercrime. It includes \nillegal access, data interference, misuse of devices, illegal interception of data, system \ninterference, computer-related fraud, offences related to child pornography, computer-\nrelated forgery, offences related to infringements of copyright and related rights. The \ntreaty is designed to provide a common law enforcement framework for dealing with \ncybercriminals81. It also fosters information sharing among all signatories. \nHowever, many countries have still not ratified the convention. It is worrying because \nsome of them are big sources of malicious code. \n \n \n                                                 \n80 European convention on cybercrime. \n81 Ibid.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1896, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2c508dd-31c2-455a-bb14-89f4ac0792b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2c508dd-31c2-455a-bb14-89f4ac0792b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "301", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc120334-ee45-43ab-8030-d47633b1efe9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "301", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "hash": "33d04781ed30f728682dcb90c39c025999e6230fbbba64524ab275e8631a5244", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "62 \n \nPERSONAL INTERNET SECURITY \nHouse of Lords Science and Technology Committee published a report on Personal \nInternet Safety in August 200782. The report heavily criticized the UK government for \nplacing the main onus on the individuals for making the internet a secure space. \nInternet was d escribed as \u201cthe playground for criminals \u201d. It suggested that there are \nmany entities which have a stake in the internet like the ISPs, police, etc. They should \nput in all efforts to promote personal internet security. \nThe Committee suggested that all part ies should take utm ost care to secure the \ninternet Companies, banks, software vendors, ISPs, etc. should put every possible \neffort that comes under their domain, to protect the internet. \nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT \nIt is true that only legislations are not enough to tackle the problem of rampant \ncybercrime unless there is adequate enforcement mechanisms to implement them. It is \nof utmost importance for police to have the resources to deal with the growing \nproblem. Af ter the Computer Misuse Act was introduced, only a very few police \nofficials outside the Metropolitan areas had the technical knowledge and expertise to \ndeal with the problem of cybercrime. Later, resources were put together to create a \ndedicated agency to deal with the problem of cybercrime. \nIn April 2001, the government established the National Hi -Tech Crime Unit to \nprovide directed response to cybercrime.it worked in association with a lot of experts \nand specialist organizations like the National Crime S quad and the National Criminal \nIntelligence Service. \nThe NHTCU was a success. It was successful in the arrest of Russian hackers and \nsome others who were trying to steal money from the London branch of the Japanese \nSumitomo Mitsui Bank in October 200483. \nIn April 2006, the NHTCU\u2019s responsibilities were taken over by the Serious \nOrganised Crime Agency (SOCA). \n                                                 \n82 Report on Personal Internet Safety, 2017 \n83 John Leyden, \u201cHow police busted UK\u2019s biggest cybercrime case\u201d, The Register , 19 March, 2009.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2111, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55765bad-55a0-4da7-8bc0-60f7c4aa87a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "55765bad-55a0-4da7-8bc0-60f7c4aa87a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "302", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2c7e448-15f4-4692-9377-f49dbadb57f5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "302", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "hash": "b9ec0ffc78a770bdb36d79140847bc9eca56a12e1c8fabb7f9f84579eb55db80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "63 \n \nIn April 2007, the rules relating to reporting of bank frauds were changed. The Fraud \nAct, 2006 was introduced which laid down that banks and other fina ncial institutions \nshould be contacted in the first instance, for reporting card, cheque and other online \nbanking frauds. The main aim of this law was to reduce the bureaucracy in the \nsystem. However, one concern of this Act was that after this there will be under \nreporting of frauds.  \nIn 2009, the Police Central crime unit(PCeU) was created. This did not replace the \nSOCA or other police agencies. It was just for coordinating the response to \ncybercrime and provide a national investigative capability for the  most serious e -\ncrime incidents 84. Then, the National Fraud Reporting Centre was introduced to \nprovide public a way to report non urgent fraud via telephone or online85. \nEven where the law is sufficient to deal with cybercrime, it falls short because of \ninadequate enforcement mechanisms. Thus, mechanisms in UK have in a way been \nable to enforce the few laws of cybercrime that are in force there.  \nUSING CIVIL LAW TO DEAL WITH CYBERCRIMINALS \nIn a paper called New Powers Against Organised and Financial Crime 86, t he \ngovernment proposed to fill the gaps in criminal law for catching the criminals by \nmaking use of civil courts, including the use of Organised Crime Prevention Orders. \nThe Courts would be able to impose an order on the basis of balance of probabilities. \nThe proposals finally took shape in Serious Crime Act 2007, to provide the best tools \nfor law enforcement agencies. \nBALANCING SECURITY AND FREEDOM \nThe Serious Crime Act came as relief as it provided the police with powers \u2018to detect, \ndisrupt and prevent se rious crime\u201987.

This \nlaw was an updated form of the Federal Wiretap Act of 1968. Several subsequent \nlegislations including the USA PATRIOT Act clarified and updated the ECPA to keep \npace with the new technologies and methods. \nTitle I of the ECPA, which is referred to as the Wiretap Act, prohibits the intentional \nactual or attempted interception of any wire, oral or electronic communic ation. It also \nprohibits procuring any person to intercept the same 98. It also prohibits the use of \ncommunications that are obtained illegally, as evidence 99. Further, it provides certain \nexceptions to service providers and other people who are authorised to  intercept wire, \noral, or electronic communications. \nTitle II of the Act is referred to as the Stored Communications Act (SCA). It \nsafeguards the privacy of the contents of the files stored by service providers. \nSecondly, it also protects the records of su bscriber held by the service providers like \nsubscriber name, IP address, etc. \nTitle III of the Act addresses pen register and trap and trace devices. It makes it \nmandatory for a government entity to obtain a court order authorising the installation \nand use of a pen register, a trap and trace device. \nThis law has not been very effective as it does not take into account how people \ncurrently share, store, and use information.

Nowadays, \nmore and more criminals are exploiting this branch of crime with the help of \ndeveloping technologies. This type of crime includes attacking computer data and \ncomputer systems, identity thefts, distribution of child sexual abuse images and the \nlike.  \nThe global nature of cybercrime has enabled criminals sitting in one part of the world \nto attack a computer in another part of the world. This has necessitated all countries to \nadopt their own domestic laws to protect their own cyberspace. This is because the \nentire world is interconnected. With increased connectivity, there is also an increased \nrisk of theft, fraud and abuse over internet. As we heavily rely on modern technology,  \nwe are becoming more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In simple words, cybercrime is the \nuse of a computer as an instrument to further illegal ends. It basically involves a \ncomputer and a network. The computer may be used in the commission of the crime \nor target of the crime. \nIn India, the only legislation dealing with cybercrimes is the Information Technology \nAct. The Act does not provide any definition of the term \u2018cybercrime\u2019. However, the \nscope of cybercrime has be made clear under the various provisions o f the Act. The \nmain purpose of this Act is to protect the field of e -commerce, e -governance, e -\nbanking as well as provides penalties and punishments in the field of cybercrime. The \nAct has Been amended by the ITAA, 2008. \nHowever, a single piece of legislat ion is not enough to protect a country with such a \nhigh rate of crime. Further, territorial jurisdiction is a major issue which has not been \nadequately addressed in the Act. Preservation of evidence is also big concern. \nHowever, most of the cybercrimes are also covered by the Indian Penal Code which is \ncomforting factor for the investigating agencies. This is because criminals, even if", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2013, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdd51e89-8e47-4470-bcb4-6f126c508314": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdd51e89-8e47-4470-bcb4-6f126c508314", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "310", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1dbab388-7e96-492f-865d-6e6bac9ff9e7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "310", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-27"}, "hash": "2d7140078b86ebdf1b3479ea754517b3d08b0fe8b8378f1a1d4a5d6139219baa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "71 \n \nthey are able to evade the IT Act, they will not be able to evade the provisions of the \nIPC.  \nUS and UK also have a well de veloped legal system to address the issue of \ncybercrimes. India is developing day by day in every sector but in terms of cyber \nlaws, it is behind the developed countries like US and UK. Most developed countries \nhave separate rules, regulations and laws whi ch deals with the cyber sector. However, \nin India, the Information Technology Act is not enough to deal with information \ntechnology and cyber sectors of India properly. India is making some progress to \nprovide better services and protection in cyber sector . In 2013, the Government of \nIndia introduced a National Cyber Security Policy with the aim of protecting \ninformation infrastructure, reducing vulnerability, increasing capabilities and \nsafeguarding it from cyber attacks. India should make the IT Act more efficient which \nneeds some more amendments in the future. The difference in approach can be \nattributed to the different circumstances existing in these countries. There is a \nsignificant gap between India and the other two countries in terms of access to \ntechnology and resources.  \nCybercrime is rampantly increasing across the world. One of the reasons for this is \ncomplex technology. Hackers are easily able to steal access codes, retina images, etc. \nto get past security systems. Secondly, storing data in smal l space makes it easy for \npeople to steal data from other storage and use for their own profit. Thirdly, due to \nweak security control systems, attackers take advantage to commit crime. In terms of \nlaw enforcement, the major deterrent would be certainty of punishment which still \ndoes not exist in India. The conviction rate is still very low. Above all, the root cause \nof this is our heavy reliance on internet. \nThe IT Act does not cover all aspects of information technology that needs protection.  \nCopyright and trademark violations have not been dealt with adequately in this Act. \nEven the internet service providers who transmits third party information have not \nbeen made liable under the Act. Thirdly, he Act does not specify how the extra \nterritoriality will be  enforced.
