Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm.\u2014\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge t hat it is likely to cause \nharm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good f aith for the purpose of \npreventing or avoiding other harm to person or property. \nExplanation.\u2014It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the ac t with the knowledge that \nit was likely to cause harm. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any f ault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a \nposition that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board , \nunless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing  his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with \nonly two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the \nboat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, \nthough he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matte r of \nfact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conf lagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \nin good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be f ound that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so \nimminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence. \n82. Act of a child under seven years of age .\u2014Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under \nseven years of age.  \n83. Act of a child above seven and under twelve of immature understanding .\u2014Nothing is an \noffence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attain ed \nsufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that \noccasion. \n84. Act of a person of unsound mind.\u2014Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the \ntime of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nat ure of the act, or that \nhe is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. \n85.

But A has the same right of private \ndefence which he would have if Z were sane. \n(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in g ood faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. \nHere Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offe nce.

Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on  it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable \nhomicide. \n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending  to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, \ninduces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z.

But if A, not knowing that Z is \nlabouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in  the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of \nhealth, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such \nbodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cau se the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \nZ dies in consequence.

A is guilty of murder, although  \nhe may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \nException 1 .\u2014When culpable homicide is not murder .\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if the \noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, c auses the death \nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:\u2014 \nFirst.\u2014That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excus e for \nkilling or doing harm to any person. \nSecondly.\u2014That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public  \nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \nThirdly.\u2014That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of \nprivate defence. \nExplanation.\u2014Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from \namounting to murder is a question of fact. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, \ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and th e death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in  \ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A.

It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has \nnot committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occup ies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A \ndishonestly removes it, A commits theft. \n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he \nmay commit criminal misappropriation of property. \n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not ven turing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is hig hly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the \nintention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it w hen the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the \nring, commits theft. \n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to h is shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters th e shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, \nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed crimi nal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as \nwhat he did was not done dishonestly.  \n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the wa tch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes \nthe watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z o f the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, \ninasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's poss ession without Z's consent, not having paid what he \nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's co nsent, with the intention of keeping it until he \nobtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence,  and takes away a book without Z's express \nconsent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived \nthat he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. \n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife.
