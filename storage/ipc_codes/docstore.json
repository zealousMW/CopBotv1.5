Use \nof the malevolent programs in computers and over internet by malicious people to \nattack data or sell contraband and someone else\u2019s identity is known as cybercrime. \nThis type of crime is committed with the use of computers and internet. A cybercrime \ncriminal is capable of hacking and planting viruses to destroy website and other \nportals across the world. Fraudulent transactions and online banking frauds are carried \nout by th em by gaining access to highly confidential information as well as cyber \npornography and various other crimes are committed. In simple words, no one is \nsecure in the cyber world.  \nLike the conventional concept of crime, cybercrime is also an act or omissio n which \nresults in breach of law and backed by sanction of the state. Two essential ingredients \nof cybercrimes are actus reus and mens rea . The main reason behind the growing \nmenace of cybercrime is our heavy dependence on computers and internet. Cyber \nspaces have advantages as well as disadvantages. Conventional crime can be \nprevented to an extent by patrolling of policemen, but in the cyber space, information \nis open to Trojan Horses and other viruses as well as to cyber stalking and cyber \nterrorism. This type of crime poses a bigger challenge to the polic, prosecutors and \nlegislators. \nStatement of problem  \nCybercrime is now a global concern engulfing the world. India is also not free from \nits clutches. It is a unique threat that is not confined to any bor der. It can be carried \nout from anywhere in the world and against any computer system. This problem has \nbecome a global issue and is becoming more difficult to bring under control.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1786, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04142bc4-d7d6-46fa-a04c-8a026ac4c67a": {"__data__": {"id_": "04142bc4-d7d6-46fa-a04c-8a026ac4c67a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "241", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "164ec1a1-7fdd-4533-a9fe-c0c2437c834c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "241", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "hash": "4bd728b43e5bf53c1d39386d24c1c337f305a41a1a17aeb2f9300e1a121d1a4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "2 \n \nObjective of the study  \nThe researcher has undertaken this topic to analyse the law of cybercrime in a \ncomprehensive manner and achieve new insights to it. The main objectives of the \npresent study are under: \n\uf0b7 To understand the basic concept of the cybercrime and forms of cyber crimes \n\uf0b7 To analyse Indian cyber crime \n\uf0b7 To decipher as to how the issue of cybercrime has been dealt with in the \nIndian scenario; \n\uf0b7 To point out the possible defects in the existing law relating to cybercrime; \n\uf0b7 To suggest the reform and remedial measure for the prevention and control of \ncybercrime. \nScope and limitation  \nThe scope of the study is to do a detailed study of cyber crimes, their magnitude and \nnature and throw light on who are the ones responsible for it. The researcher will also \nanalyse the success and failure of the efforts taken by India in c ombating this type of \ncrime. Efforts will be made to analyse the law as laid down in the IT Act, 2000, its \nimplementation, shortcomings and efforts to repair them as well as referring to the \nITAA, 2008. The researcher will also compare the selected provisi ons of Indian \nlegislation with that of US and UK wherever necessary. The only limitation of this \npaper is that it covers only the laws of India and only two other developed countries \ni.e. US and UK. \nHypothesis  \nThe hypothesis of this paper is that cyber se curity at national level is poor and \ninadequate. The cyber space is not adequately protected. A huge number of \npopulation is present in the cyber space every moment and are using very well \ndeveloped complicated technologies. Developed technologies require developed \nprotection mechanisms. This demands  for having comprehensive and effective laws \nand regulations for the protection of the population from the various cyber crimes.

These sites provided space for many to relax, connect with old friends \nand also get new also.1 But the cyber-criminal organizations have sadly misused these \nsites to serve their criminal acts. In the past couple of years, people started spending \nmore  time on these networks as the populations are gradually dependent on them. In \nthe digital era, information technology growth influences the lives of people all over \nthe world. Day after day, modern inventions and discoveries have broadened the \nscience spectrum and created new problems for the legal community. With the rapid \ndevelopment of this technology leads to the commission on cyber space with \nemerging different types of new cybercrime  today, which has also been a topic of \nglobal interest in the future. \nIn the cyber world era as computer use became more widespread, the rise of \ntechnology also grew, and people became more familiar with the word 'cyber.' The \nevolution of IT gives rise to the \"cyber space\" in which internet provides all people \nwith equal opportunities to access information , analysis, data storage, etc.  by using \nhigh technology.2 Such offences are like the assault on people, companies, or \ngovernments' guarded records. Such types of attacks don't  exist on the physical body \nbut on virtual body, either personal or corporate. \nTechnology has exploded into communities, businesses, and  individual\u2019s life  over \nthe last two decades, altering the way people study, work and interact . People in \ndifferent parts of the world can connect on a range of devices , such as computers, cell \nphones or tablets in real time.3 A text message, photo, video,  or email exchanged by a \nsingle person can be seen by hun  Dreds users  in a couple of seconds, and can go \nviral. The IT  has now become a modern tool for harassing,, doing misconduct or \nbullying,  manipulating and harming others. \n                                                 \n1   Dr.S.V.Joga Rao \u201cLaw of Cyber Crimes and Information Technology Law\u201d, p.109 (2 nd ed. 2009). \n2 Farooq Ahmad, \u201cCyber Law in India- Law on Internet\u201d, p. 367, (2nd ed. 2008) . \n3 Saraswathi Murali, \u201c Information Technology Handbook\u201d,  p.234, (2003)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2347, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63891c16-09f1-4069-8346-ee63e81e4829": {"__data__": {"id_": "63891c16-09f1-4069-8346-ee63e81e4829", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "876ff37e-6d6c-4cd7-93ad-ef8bf499047c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "246", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "hash": "dc50647c12bf128f6f6057143b29aa48793389b932004198eca04968510875e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7 \n \nThrough a socio-cultural viewpoint, there is a negative distinction between the \nlimitations of machine criminal activity of  environmental (computer availability) and \nsocietal (norms, legislation)  which is a direct consequence of technology \nglobalization.

Now it's used to \nexplain anything related to computers , IT, the internet and the complex culture of the \ninternet. Also referred to as 'Cyber Space' is the cyber environment in which all \ninformation technology   Driven contact and actions take place. Cyberspace can not \nbe placed spatially. It's made of intangible objects like the website, forum, social \nnetworks, personal information, reputation and email addresses. Cyber space can be \ncalled an online global community with quick connectivity and no territorial barriers.5 \nCyber space is the interactive system of computer networks where online \ncommunication takes place between the people  and where people can communicate, \nexchange ideas, transfer knowledge, provide social support, perform business,  create \nartistic media, direct actions, participate in political dialogue, etc.6 Cyberspace, the \nmodern frontier, is mankind's shared heritage, but sadly certain people exploit the \ncommon heritage and thus cyberspace is indeed a new frontier with various forms of \ncrime. Now it's used to explain anything related to computers, IT, the internet and the \ncomplex culture of the internet.7 The people participating in cyberspace are \nrecognized as netizens by the fusion of two terms 'Net' and 'citizen.'

Astonishing \nchanges have been made in the crime area. The growing understanding of criminality \nall over the world relies on the development of individuals in society. The definition \nof crime occurs in different ways in various countries at all times, Like if xyz crime is \ncrime in country A, same may not be  crime in country B. \nThe emergence of the new method of the criminality due to industrial growth and \nincome accumulation,   Dramatic advancement in the mass media has modified the \ndefinition of conventional crimes such as homicide, dacoity, kidnapping, arson, \nstealing, pornography, adultery, etc. both quantitatively and qualitatively, and brought \nnew modes of crime. \nNATURE OF CRIMES \nIn fact, most of the societies have such values, principles, practices and rituals that its \nparticipants indirectly accept as favorable to their well-being and safe growth. Anti-\nsocial behavior is condemned as infringement of these norms and customs. Human \n                                                 \n8 1 R.C.

There are many human behaviours in our society some are \nforbidden by civil law, criminal law and moral code, crimes and those not forbidden \nby these are not wrong.  The evolving character of crime can be understood as \nfollows: \nCrime is a public wrong according to Blackstone. He describes crime in two ways: \nfirst, criminality is an act committed or excluded in violation of public statute that \nforbids or commands it. We cannot support this concept in its entirety because \nAdministrative Law and constitutional law etc. are infringements of public law but are \nnot crimes. Second, he modifies his definition of crime and states a crime is a breach \nof the duties of public rights owed to the society as a whole, regarded as a \ncommunity.10 \n Editor of the Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, Stephen, further modified the \naforementioned definition and said \"a crime is a violation of a right, considered in \nreference to the evil tendency of such violation as regards the community at large.\"11 \nHe further added that an act is crime if it is forbidden by the law and against the \nsocieties\u2019 moral sentiments. \nSecondly, Crime is social wrong. John Gillin describes criminality as an act which has \nbeen proven to be objectively detrimental to society, or which is considered to be \nharmful socially by a group of individuals who have the ability to impose their views, \nand which puts such activities under the prohibition of constructive sanctions.12 \nThirdly, crime as conventional wrong. According to Edwin Sutherland Crime as \ncriminal conduct in contravention of the law. Doesn\u2019t matter what the degree of \nimmorality,   unless the legislation forbids it, it\u2019s not a crime.  \n                                                 \n10 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, vol.

According to Austin \u201cwrong which is pursued \nby the sovereign or his subordinate is a crime. A wrong which is pursued at the \ndiscretion of the injured party and his representatives is a civil injury.\u201d13 \nFifthly, crime as legal wrong, according to the Halbury, crime can be understood as \nillegal activity which is offence against the society, and wrong doer is liable for his \nact for legal punishment. 14 According to the section 40 of the IPC offence means \nwhich is punishable under this Act. \nFUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF CRIME \nTo prove anybody whether he/she guilty of any offence under criminal law, evidence \nof Actus reus  and Mens rea have to show except in strict liability crimes. Initially in \nEurope wrongdoer were inflicted with many charges, they did not considered the \nMens rea as important element. But later on development in criminal law, before \nimposing any punishment, they start consider both Mens rea and actus reus.  And acts \nreas must be proved beyond the reasonable doubt.  \nInitially crimes were simple and in very limited nature so that time criminal law was \nalso plain. After 13th century some cases of serious offence came they led to first \ndistinction between trot and crime. With criminal liability moral blame was linked. By \nthis change mental element in liability got recognition. \n There are two important element of crime namely  \n1. Actus reus in Cyber Crimes \nActus reus defined as \u201csuch result of human conduct as the law seeks to prevent\u201d15 in \ncybercrime actus reus is highly varied and dynamic. In simple word actus reus means \nresult of human conduct.it does not include mental element. it does not limited  an act \nonly , but also includes state of affairs. \nC.J. Smith & B. Hogan found actus reus to be a product of human action because the \nlaw attempts to prevent it. Simply guilty intent is not adequate to resolve the criminal \nfault but any act or omission is required to complete the offence.

The act can be \nconsidered a crime may be said to have happened when a person makes use of \ncomputer function; or trying to obtain access from the internet or sending signals via \ndifferent computers.16 In cases of rape, an important feature of the actus reus is \nabsence of the consent on part of prosecutor. If the prosecutor can not show this \ndenial of consent then the actus reus of accused does not prove and the case will lose \nhere. In this context we can say that mens rea also forms part of actus reus. \n2. Mens rea in cybercrime  \nAccording to the current jurisprudence crime can be committed with mens rea. Mens \nrea is  second basic factor that constitutes crime, sometimes referred to as 'a guilty \nmind.' definition of mens rea  underwent a gradual shift before modern criminal law \ncame to accept as often necessary a guilty mind of some sort or some such mental \nfeature. 17Mens rea, refers to the individual's thematic intention to commit the act. \nThe act remains same although the state of mind causes the act 'reus' and therefore an \noffence. Quick all crimes need evidence of some kind of a mental dimension. many \ncourts held that 'primarily all crime exists in the mind' Each offence requires a clear \nstate of mind reflected by the terms in the particular section of the law: \u2018recklessly\u2019, \n\u2018with intent\u2019, \u2018maliciously\u2019, \u2018wilfully\u2019, unlawfully\u2019, \u2018knowingly\u2019, \u2018fraudulently\u2019, \n\u2018dishonestly\u2019, \u2018corruptly\u2019, \u2018knowing or believing\u2019, \u2018allowing\u2019 and \u2018permitting\u2019 \nExpressing different mental states which differ from one another. However, the basic \ntenets of criminal liability are motive, recklessness and knowledge.18 \nIt consists of a large number of different mental activities such as recklessness, \nnegligence, intention etc. word intention is used for a man's state of mind not only \nbecause of his ability to predict but also because it contains the expectation of the \nfuture result of his actions, as it is rightly believed that there can be no intention \n                                                 \n16 Ibid.  \n17 J.C.

When a man decides to do particular act, then he must \nhave fair foresight of the consequences of such an act. There are no criminal liability \nunder the Common Law for any damage or injury caused by a individual without   \nconduct or any intention which is not unexpected. \nMens rea has been accepted as an integral component of crime except in criminal \noffences where there is a strict liability. Since the rise of e-crimes, the legal \ncommunity is facing the challenge of defining mens rea in cybercrimes, in addition to \nmany others.19 As an important component for deciding mens rea in cybercrime, the \noffender's part is that at the time of causing t computer to perform the task, he / she \nmust be informed that  access intended to be obtained was not lawful. There must be \nintention on the part of hacker to secure access, although that intention may be \ndirected with any computer and not with a particular computer. Therefore the hackers \ndoes not need to be aware of exactly which computer he / she was attacking. There \nare two important ingredients that make up the mens rea, in hacking, 1) access \nintended to be protected must've been unauthorized, 2)as there should be knowledge \non the part of hacker regarding the access. \nThe mens rea requires two important elements in the case of cybercrimes. 1) \n'Intention to secure access to the any software or data stored on any computer, \ncomputer network or computer system must be made.  2) The individual must know \nthat access he intends to obtain is unauthorized at the time when he commits actus \nreus.20The nature and skilled involved in the cybercrime such that current legal \nframework couldn't do much to handle and contain same thing.

In the case of \ncybercrime, proving all aspects of Crime is very difficult. Actus reus of the \ncybercrime is very varied and dynamic.22  For example , when any  person starts using \na mouse and  keyboard  to work with a computer and attempts to access the \ninformation on the others computers without his permission, there is presence of actus \nreus in the cyber space that the law seeks to control. \nIn a debate about whether a new law is required to deal with this emerging type of \ncrime, cybercrimes have set in. The order school gives some creditability to the \npeculiar existence of new technology and peculiar set of problems unfamiliar to \ncurrent criminal jurisprudence, such as scope and nature  of cybercrimes, intention \nand difficulty in identifying the accused, jurisdiction and compliance. It contends that \nfor dealing with cybercrimes requires a new comprehensive legislation. \nTwo approaches should be implemented to combat cybercrimes: firstly, crime related \nto computer must be treated as both conventional crime and current crimes committed \nthrough the use of high-tech technology, secondly, crime related to computer must be \nviewed as a crime that is special in nature and requires new legal structure. \n \n \n                                                 \n21   Dr. Vijaykumar shrikrushna chowbe, \u201c The Concept of Cyber Crime:N ature, Scope\u201d, p. 15,  21 \nfebruary (2011) SSRN, \n22 M.

The term cyber signifies the cyber \nspace, and it means the computer-modelled information space in which there are \ndifferent objects or information of symbols image exist. It is, therefore, the place \nwhere computer programs operate and data processing takes place.24 \nCybercrimes are nothing but real-life crimes perpetuated in digital medium and thus \nthere is little distinction between the concept of a crime in the cyber world and the \nreal world. The only difference is medium of crime. Cybercrime is ' 'transnational or \ninternational' \u2013 there is no border in cyber world. Computer crime, cybercrime, \nelectronic crime, e-crime or hi-tech crime typically refers to illegal activity in which \ncomputer or network is  source, device, target or crime location  as well as \nconventional crime through  use of technology such as , Internet fraud, child \npornography. \nBroadly cybercrime means an act or omission, which committed on through internet \nconnectivity, may me directly or indirectly, this is forbidden by any statute, and for \nwhich corporal and/or monetary punishment is given. \nDEFINITION OF CYBER CRIME \nThe term 'cybercrime' as a generic term that refers to all type criminal activities \nperpetrated through the use of computers, the Internet on the cyber space and the \nwww. In India, in no law has any definition of the term 'cybercrime' been given yet. In \naddition, the IPC 1860 does not at any time use the word 'cybercrime.

In plain language cybercrime \nmeans crime engaged in computer network or computer. But in such simplistic and \nlimited terms complex nature of the cybercrimes can't be sufficiently expressed. \nCybercrime, according to Pavan Duggal, refers to all activities that are carried out \nwith criminal intention  in cyberspace or using  internet medium. These can be either \ntraditional or newly developed criminal activities with growth of new medium. Any \nconduct that basically offends human awareness may be included in the cybercrime \ncontext. \nCommit a crime with the using of computer technology is better definition of \ncybercrime; engaging in activities that threaten the ability of a society to maintain \ninternal order. So this definition covers both traditional cybercrimes and the emerging \nones. This also includes the use of computer technology, and not just the use of the \nnetworked computer technology. \nTRADITIONAL CRIME AND CYBER CRIME \nCybercrimes, which are distinctly different from the traditional crimes, are often more \ndifficult to detect and prosecute. Cybercrimes are perpetrated by perpetrators through \nsmall, targeted cyber threats, and large networks of commercial purposes leased, \nhijacked computers are used to launch significant attacks.26 Researching on  legal \nissues of  the cybercrime in China, by Chen Junjiing concludes that such crimes are \nmuch more widespread unlike traditional crimes and these are increasing at  faster \nrate. In addition, cybercrime harms society more than traditional crime, and is much \nmore difficult to investigate. \nCybercrime contains any computer and network-related criminal act. In addition, \ncyber-crime also includes traditional Internet-based crimes. or example;  \ntelemarketing, hate crimes, fraud on the Internet and identity theft, are considered \n                                                 \n25 Prabhash Dalei & Tannya Brahme, \u201dCyber law in India: An analysis\u201d, 2  IJHAS,  p.1, (2013).  \n26 The Swedish Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 2008 report,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2354, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da4e7b4d-a3c9-4caf-97f5-d05e5dce6529": {"__data__": {"id_": "da4e7b4d-a3c9-4caf-97f5-d05e5dce6529", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "255", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34291e24-5a4b-4cab-8dfe-ed4f38812aad", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "255", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "hash": "1d3851884165d237d234a86af48bca03c155f6b1e4eb2b9fc7b907d96c055f09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "16 \n \ncybercrimes when illegal activities are committed using a computer and  Internet.27 \nCybercrime hackers are skilled criminals, disgruntled workers, professional,  \ndisillusioned youth, and state critics in contrast with conventional crimes. \nThe other distinction is based on evidence of crimes between these two words. In \nconventional crimes the offenders typically leave some traces of the crime, such as \nfingerprints or any other physical evidence, after or during the execution of the crime. \nBut in cybercrimes cybercriminals commit their crime via the internet and there is \nvery little chance of leaving any evidence. According to Forensic investigators who \nusually have experience of difficulty in evidence gathering for conviction of the cyber \ncriminals because they either  change their identities or do  crime on the basis of the \nfake identities But as compared to conventional criminals, faking their age, sexuality, \nrace , etc. is very difficult.28 \nDepending on the use of power, those two words can be distinguished. Many of the \ncrimes such as robbery, murder, rape, etc. in traditional crimes involve use of excess \nforce which leads to the physical injury on the person suffered. But as compared to \ncybercrimes there's really no requisite to use any type of force since in this crime \ncriminals only use other person's identities in order to steal any private data etc. \nRELATION BETWEEN CYBER CRIME AND CYBER SECURITY \nCyber crime \nCyber criminality is a crime involving use of the computer devices and Internet.

Information security-   intellectual property, business records, customer data, \npersonal data, etc. Information included.  It is therefore important for a \ncompany to have very strong cyber security for data/information in order to \navoid leakage.  \nSecurity of information involves the safeguarding of sensitive information \nfrom unlawful access, use or other damage. This also means that critical data \nwill not get lost if any problems such as malfunction of system, natural \ndisasters, fraud or other potentially harmful circumstances occur. Integrity, \nconfidentiality and availability are the characteristics which define information \nsecurity. Data privacy , data quality, data reliability  and  Data confidentiality,  \nare all part of information security. \n3. Network Security- Network security is about safeguarding network and data \nusability and reliability. Network penetration test is performed to evaluate \nvulnerabilities within a system and network. \nThis applies to broad variety of security policies to thwart and track \nunauthorized access, abuse, computer device harm and other network \nstructures. Network protection extends coverage across companies and \norganizations, to multiple computer networks covering private and public \ncommunication systems. \n4. Business continuity planning- Its aim is to prepare for any form of intrusion or \ncyber threat by detecting timely threats to  systems and evaluating how they \ncould impact the operations and methods to combat that danger. This also \ncalled as Disaster Recovery. \n5. Operational security (OPSEC)- it is used for  protecting functions of the \norganisation. This defines essential information and properties in functional \nsystem to monitor the risks and vulnerabilities. \n6. End-user education- Training their employees about the cyber security is \ncritical for an organization, since data breached caused due to the human error. \nEach employee must be aware of and have knowledge to deal with the common \ncyber threats. \n                                                 \n35 Ibid.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2169, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "617eb21c-b033-48a7-9918-752c8650d06a": {"__data__": {"id_": "617eb21c-b033-48a7-9918-752c8650d06a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "259", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "817728b1-217e-46fc-9905-3159b98a49d9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "259", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "hash": "e46caad8c0fbc30bf3fece45e8fe4855a22803af0cfe0da9ac5a4e18f6030cfb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "20 \n \nTraining can help management to get used to and threats to system users and \ntraining of user will help eliminate resistance to change and improvements and \nlead to closer user scrutiny. \n7.

CYBERCRIME AGAINST THE PERSON \nCybercrime against persons committed. This form of offences directly influenced the \nindividual's personality. Following are the cybercrimes of some kinds that threat the \nuser.36 \nHarassment via E-Mails- This form of harassment is very popular by file \nattachments, sending letters, & links, i.e. through e-mails. Harassment is growing \nnowadays as the use of social media sites. like Twitter, Facebook, orkut, instagram, \netc. day by day increasing. \nCyber-Stalking- The phrase derives from the term 'stalking,' which means following \na person to embarrass or harass that person. If computer or email is used for commit \nstalking.  \nIt is often achieved by using certain criminal activities such as   abuse of identity, \nextortion, defamation, spoofing etc. Cyber stalkers may create fake websites, create \nfake forums, send threatening spam, make fake profile or send harassing mails for \nstalk another person. \nCyber Defamation- for causing defamation Injury can be done through oral or \nwritten words, or through signs or visible representations. The person making that \ndefamatory comment must be intent to lowering the image of person about whom the \naccusation was made in general public's eyes. \n                                                 \n36 Prabhash Dalei &amp; Tannya Brahme, Cyber law in India: An analysis, 2013.

It is a very dangerous cybercrime against any human. \nCarding It means fake credit and Debit cards used by offenders with  Draw money \nfrom the bank account  of victim for their monetary gains. This type of cybercrimes \noften includes illegal use of ATM cards. \nChild Pornography- Defaulters in this cybercrime create access materials or \ndistribute that exploit the sexual exploitation of minors. This is classified among \nIndia's most heinous type of cybercrime \nPhishing- Phishing is financial crime in which criminal acts as a legitimate individual \nand sends an email demanding that person update his records or may be  confirm   \ndetails of his credit card and acquires confidential personal information. \n2.

These actions may take form of a \ncomputer theft, any computer component. \nHacking Computer System- Hackers target those like Popular Facebook, twitter, \nInstagram, blogging site via unauthorized computer access / control. These attacks \nwere not intended primarily for financial gain as well as to diminish public image of a \nparticular company or person.  In April, 2013, hackers targeted MMM India. \nTransmitting Virus: virus is a type of programs which is written by the programmers \nwhich attach to a pc or file and then transmit to other computers and files on a \nnetwork in order to alter or delete it. \nCyber Trespass: it means accessing in to computer or network of someone without \nany right or authority of owner and alters, misuse, disturb and damage data by using \ninternet. \n3.

To avoid misuse of the \ndata or loss of confidential information, it is important for the employees to take \nspecial care of the data of the company and protect it from family members and \nfriends. In addition to company information, an individual's personal confidential and \nfinancial information is also at risk given the increase in the cyber-attacks.39 \nCovid-19 and Malware, Spyware, Ransom ware 40 \nVirus Attacks ,During this lockdown period , people access websites on social media \nsuch as twitter, Facebook , instagram,  more frequently than watching series and \nmovies  by subscribing to the web channels such as Amazon, Netflix ,   Zee 5, \nHotStar etc. and even indulging in the online games by downloading various \napplications. Both of these practices are internet-based. People have to provide and/or \noffer permissions to readily access their personal details on their mobile, tablets, \ncomputers, and social media pages in order to use services offered by applications. \nMany times, users share financial information too in order to purchase applications or \naccess online services. Citizens are becoming more dependent on different payment \ngates to pay their electricity bills, recharge their cell phones, purchase online essential \ngoods and medicines, and participate in the  various online activities of this nature. \nAll those activities opened the door to attacks on ransom ware and spyware. A \nspyware steals the user's confidential personal data thus, ransom ware monitors a \nperson's username and other important credentials.

The difference between the two is that \nin Section 43, it was a civil offence with compensation and damages, whereas in this \nsection, it is the same act done with a criminal intention for making it a criminal \noffence. The act of data theft mentioned in Section 43, if done fraudulently and \ndishonestly is punishable under this sec. with 3 years\u2019 imprisonment or 5 lakh rupees \nfine or both.

The question is whether something which is an offence can be \ntaught academically by prefixing \u2018ethical\u2019 to it. Then, courses like \u2018ethical assault\u2019, \n\u2018ethical burglary\u2019 can also be taught for physical defence. This anomaly was brought \nto an end by ITAA when Section 66 was rephrased by mapping it with civil liability \nof Sec. 43 and removed the word \u2018Hacking\u2019. Hacking is still and offence under this \nsection. Though some experts interpret it definitely according their convenience. They \nsay hacking is for the good purpose and \u2018cracking\u2019 is for the illegal purpose. The \ntechnology is same.

Unauthorized modification of computer material69 \nMaximum sentence prescribed for the offences is ten years for the fourth offence. The \nsentence for the second and the third offence is five years whereas it is six months for \nthe first offence. The first prosecution under this Act was brought about in 1995 when \nan individual, Christopher Pile, was prosecuted for distributing a computer virus. He \nhad created the virus Pathogen and Queeg. Both of these malwares implemented his \nSMEG (Simulated Metamorphi c Encryption Generator) polymorphic engine. This \nmade it more difficult to be detected and were designed to trash the victim\u2019s hard   \nDrive. He placed these viruses on bulletin boards in the form of games and anti virus \nprograms.

Computer misuse was added to the list of serious \ncrimes with maximum penalty being increased to a prison sentence of 14 years and \nfine, if found guilty. If an individual is charged with an offence that constitutes a \nthreat to the national security or hum an welfare in general, the sentence can be upto \nlifetime imprisonment. \nThere were subsequent developments to the Act. In 2006, Section 37 of the Police and \nJustice Act, 2006 was inserted in the Computer Misuse Act as Section 3A. This \nsection classified making, supplying or obtaining any article for use in a malicious act \nusing a computer, as a criminal activity. \nPROBLEMS \nThus, the Computer Misuse Act was enacted to help deal with the problem of misuse \nof computers by way of \u2018hacking\u2019 and \u2018unauthorised access\u2019. \nThe Act was a way forward in terms of cyber laws in the UK. However, it still had \nmany loopholes and had failed to combat the challenges of unauthorised access \ngained by hackers or viruses created by cyber criminals. The case of R v. Bedworth  \n[1991] proves the problem with Section 2 in proving \u2018intent\u2019. This case is a peculiar \nexample of how the offender had used the defence of addiction to counter the \nallegation of intention of committing the crime. He had pleaded that he had no \nintention in commi tting the crime. Strangely, even though addiction is not a defence \nto a crime, the jury had acquitted him as they believed that he did not deserve heavy \npenalty. \nAnother loophole that might come as a blow is that the judges might lack technical \nknowledge r egarding the use of computers. Inadequate knowledge will make it \ndifficult to apply the law properly and tend to make inappropriate interpretations. This \nproblem was highlighted in Rv. Cropp [1991] where the judge acquitted the person on \nthe basis of his opinion that an offence was only committed if one computer is used to \n                                                 \n74Explanatory Notes , Serious Crime Act 2015 available at \nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/9/pdfs/ukpgaen_20150009_en.pdf> last accessed on May \n25, 2020.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2252, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6689855e-e1ce-4cab-867b-cfac1b4deab7": {"__data__": {"id_": "6689855e-e1ce-4cab-867b-cfac1b4deab7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "298", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "284279c0-7949-4a0d-94d0-c7afc6e118e0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "298", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "hash": "37cbaba20d5df1fc5096fedbacc12343a17a3a511725bd2604df96e39214ae38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "59 \n \nobtain material stored on another computer. His was not the correct interpretation and \nit sprung from the judges\u2019 inadequate technical knowledge about computers.  \nThese are the problems that raise questions on  effectiveness of prosecuting offenders \nand preventing hackers. The definition of \u2018computer crimes\u2019 is too broad in the Act as \nit simply states \u2018unauthorised access to computer material\u2019. This had created problems \nin the case of DPP v. Bignell [1998] . The   Drafting of the law seems very general \nand casual. With time, it has just become a blunt  instrument when policing \ncybercrimes. This is proved from the fact that inspite of high reporting of crimes, \nthere have been very few prosecutions till date75. \nSPAM, MALWARE AND THE LAW \nMostly, everybody deals with the problem of spam. The problem of spam is \nwidespread. It does not only include inappropriate content but it is also used to deliver \nmalicious code to the recipients. Spam messages work in a way that the recipients will \nopen the link to the website which are infected with malicious codes by cyber \ncriminals. This method is also used by phishers to direct victims to fake websites from \nwhere their confidential data is stolen. \nTo address the problem of spam, the Department for Trade and Industry introduced \nthe \u201cPrivacy and Electronic Communication Regulations (EC Directive) 2003.\u201d These \nregulations exist alongside the Data Protection Act and the GDPR. These regulations \nprotect specific pri vacy rights of people in relation to electronic communications 76. \nThey have specific rules on: \na) Marketing calls, emails, texts and faxes \nb) Cookies (and similar technologies) \nc) Keeping communications services secure \nd) Customer privacy as regards traffic and locatio n data, itemized billing, line \nidentification, and directory listings77. \n                                                 \n75 Michael J L Turner, \u201cComputer Evidence\u201d available at \nhttps://www.computerevidence.co.uk/Cases/CMA.htm  last accessed on May 25, 2020 \n76 PECR, available at https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/what-are-pecr/ last accessed on \nMay 25, 2020 \n77 Ibid.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2162, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5393978f-9a98-4eb3-bdd7-a17885213cbf": {"__data__": {"id_": "5393978f-9a98-4eb3-bdd7-a17885213cbf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "299", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "533cd418-76f3-438c-bc13-948f0f1bfbda", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "299", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "hash": "f027dd25f3d0636003319ddb3b74899dd338aeede3e8cd34ea36952318de66ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "60 \n \nThese regulations were derived from the European Law. It had implemented the \nEuropean Directive 2002/58/EC, which is also called \u2018the e-privacy Directive\u201978. \nThe e-privacy Directive is complementing the general data protection regime. It also \nsets out very specific privacy rights of all entities in the domain of electronic \ncommunication. It very categorically acknowledges the fact that the use of computer \nand internet poses new threats to the privacy of people. \nThe PECR have been amended many times till now. Last amendment was in 2018 \nwhere cold calling of claims management services was banned. Secondly, director\u2019s \nliability for serious breaches of marketing rules was inserted. In 2019, c old calling of \npension schemes was banned and the definition of consent was incorporated from the \nGDPR. \nThese regulations mandated that companies must seek permission before sending \nemails or SMS messages. The law states that no one is permitted to transmi t \nunsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing unless the recipient \nhas consented to receiving such messages.  \nHowever, there are limitations of this law. These regulations only apply to individual \nemail addresses and not business email addresses. The penalties are also inadequate as \ncompared to the ones provided under the Computer Misuse Act, 1990. Breach of any \nprovision of this regulation requires reporting of the act too the Information \nCommissioner\u2019s Office who is responsible for dec iding whether the person should be \ntaken to the court or not. \nAnother serious limitation is that the legislation is only applicable to senders within \nthe UK. Most spam originates beyond the UK (Russia and US are the top sources of \nspam)79. Thus, if this leg islation is not applicable beyond UK, it is not effective \nagainst the actual spammers. This highlights a very important problem with the \nmeasures taken by the countries to combat cyber crime and deal with cyber criminals: \ngeo-political restrictions. \n \n                                                 \n78 Ibid. \n79 Darya Gudkova , Daria Bronnikova, \u201cKaspersky Security Bulletin: Spam Evolution 2008\u201d , March 2 \n, 2009.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2177, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cdeff9c-a1f2-4356-954c-81503f005c20": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cdeff9c-a1f2-4356-954c-81503f005c20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "300", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5fd8244b-566e-41e8-91e6-91ceabbf2298", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "300", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "hash": "068ba6115d567bb3f9044d095e628ae992e7e6a4498621d475fcb3c42a021f4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "61 \n \nTHE POLICE AND JUSTICE ACT 2006 \nThis Act incorporates the amendments to the Computer Misuse Act.

The European \nConvention on Cybercrime was introduced for the purpose of providing a common \nframework for dealing with cyber crimes. It was adopted in November 2001 by the \nEU Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe80. \nThe treaty is very wide n scope and covers a wide range of cybercrime. It includes \nillegal access, data interference, misuse of devices, illegal interception of data, system \ninterference, computer-related fraud, offences related to child pornography, computer-\nrelated forgery, offences related to infringements of copyright and related rights. The \ntreaty is designed to provide a common law enforcement framework for dealing with \ncybercriminals81. It also fosters information sharing among all signatories. \nHowever, many countries have still not ratified the convention. It is worrying because \nsome of them are big sources of malicious code. \n \n \n                                                 \n80 European convention on cybercrime. \n81 Ibid.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1896, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "Metadata:\n{metadata_str}\n---\nContent:\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "747f1e31-db0d-4fd3-98f2-7361c18717f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "747f1e31-db0d-4fd3-98f2-7361c18717f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "301", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ef83da6-a227-4671-a48f-34c878ffacc3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "301", "file_name": "IPC_codes.pdf", "file_path": "data\\IPC_codes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1811141, "creation_date": "2025-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-12"}, "hash": "33d04781ed30f728682dcb90c39c025999e6230fbbba64524ab275e8631a5244", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "62 \n \nPERSONAL INTERNET SECURITY \nHouse of Lords Science and Technology Committee published a report on Personal \nInternet Safety in August 200782.

After this, the main concern was relating to the \nimpact on civil liberties.

With the growth in complicated information technology regime and the e -\ncommerce sector in the US, there is a rapid rise in cybercrimes, causing huge losses to \nthe government and the people.  \nIn the US, data breaches have gained particular attention due to the heavy impact on \nthe financial, healthcare and other sectors. After the development of complicated \ndigital platforms, data breaches have assumed new dimensio ns and have caused more \nlosses than ever before. \nThe number of data breaches in the US increased from 157 million in 2005 to 781 \nmillion in 2015. In 2019, number of data breaches was 1473 with 164.68 million \nrecords exposed88. \nThe year 2019 witnessed the la rgest data breach till date in US history. In 2016, \nYahoo revealed that hackers stole user data and information of atleast 500 million \naccounts in 201489.

Nowadays, \nmore and more criminals are exploiting this branch of crime with the help of \ndeveloping technologies. This type of crime includes attacking computer data and \ncomputer systems, identity thefts, distribution of child sexual abuse images and the \nlike.  \nThe global nature of cybercrime has enabled criminals sitting in one part of the world \nto attack a computer in another part of the world. This has necessitated all countries to \nadopt their own domestic laws to protect their own cyberspace. This is because the \nentire world is interconnected. With increased connectivity, there is also an increased \nrisk of theft, fraud and abuse over internet. As we heavily rely on modern technology,  \nwe are becoming more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In simple words, cybercrime is the \nuse of a computer as an instrument to further illegal ends. It basically involves a \ncomputer and a network. The computer may be used in the commission of the crime \nor target of the crime. \nIn India, the only legislation dealing with cybercrimes is the Information Technology \nAct. The Act does not provide any definition of the term \u2018cybercrime\u2019. However, the \nscope of cybercrime has be made clear under the various provisions o f the Act. The \nmain purpose of this Act is to protect the field of e -commerce, e -governance, e -\nbanking as well as provides penalties and punishments in the field of cybercrime. The \nAct has Been amended by the ITAA, 2008. \nHowever, a single piece of legislat ion is not enough to protect a country with such a \nhigh rate of crime. Further, territorial jurisdiction is a major issue which has not been \nadequately addressed in the Act. Preservation of evidence is also big concern. \nHowever, most of the cybercrimes are also covered by the Indian Penal Code which is \ncomforting factor for the investigating agencies.

India is developing day by day in every sector but in terms of cyber \nlaws, it is behind the developed countries like US and UK. Most developed countries \nhave separate rules, regulations and laws whi ch deals with the cyber sector. However, \nin India, the Information Technology Act is not enough to deal with information \ntechnology and cyber sectors of India properly. India is making some progress to \nprovide better services and protection in cyber sector . In 2013, the Government of \nIndia introduced a National Cyber Security Policy with the aim of protecting \ninformation infrastructure, reducing vulnerability, increasing capabilities and \nsafeguarding it from cyber attacks. India should make the IT Act more efficient which \nneeds some more amendments in the future. The difference in approach can be \nattributed to the different circumstances existing in these countries. There is a \nsignificant gap between India and the other two countries in terms of access to \ntechnology and resources.  \nCybercrime is rampantly increasing across the world. One of the reasons for this is \ncomplex technology. Hackers are easily able to steal access codes, retina images, etc. \nto get past security systems. Secondly, storing data in smal l space makes it easy for \npeople to steal data from other storage and use for their own profit. Thirdly, due to \nweak security control systems, attackers take advantage to commit crime. In terms of \nlaw enforcement, the major deterrent would be certainty of punishment which still \ndoes not exist in India. The conviction rate is still very low. Above all, the root cause \nof this is our heavy reliance on internet. \nThe IT Act does not cover all aspects of information technology that needs protection.  \nCopyright and trademark violations have not been dealt with adequately in this Act. \nEven the internet service providers who transmits third party information have not \nbeen made liable under the Act. Thirdly, he Act does not specify how the extra \nterritoriality will be  enforced.

However, it should be the \nendeavor of all to keep the crime at the lowest.

Wha t is \nwrong is that when it falls in the wrong hands with a criminal intent who misuse them \nand then commit cybercrime. Hence, it should be the constant effort of the law makers \nto ensure that technology grows but is used legally and ethically and not for \ncommitting crimes. \nFUTURE PROSPECTS \nIt is a known fact that cybercrime is not going to disappear altogether. Cybercrime is a \nside effect of our growing dependence on the internet. If something is useful, there \nwill always be someone to misuse it. Cyber laws  are all about mitigating the risks \nassociated with the use of internet. \nTo deal with the risk, there needs to be a global legal framework along with adequate \nenforcement mechanisms. Many of the law enforcement agencies have developed \nexpertise in dealing with hi -tech crimes. There must be an international legislation \napplicable globally without the limitation of any boundaries, development of \u2018cyber -\ninterpol\u2019 to pursue criminals beyond geo-political borders. This way, we will progress \nin combating against cybercrime. \nLaw enforcement is not the only solution. We have to ensure that each individual and \nbusiness entities are aware of the risks associated with the use of internet. All need to \nbe aware of how to minimize their exposure to cybercrime. This is more important for \ninexperienced people who are regular users of online shopping, internet banking and \nsocial networking.

Harsher laws are required to deal with criminals and also certainty of \npunishment is required.  \nThirdly, it is very important to have Extradition Treaties among count ries to make \nextra territorial provisions workable. \nLastly, all countries need to update their laws either by amendments or by adopting \nunified laws.
